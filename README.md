# Random-Motion-Model
Models random motion with python

This purpose of this project is to model random motion and represent it visually using matplotlib.
The blue point represents where the particle of the model started its movement.
The red point represents where the particle ended its movement.
The green color represents the path the particle travelled through, and the color gets darker as the particle covers more distance.

This project was gotten by following instructions from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
